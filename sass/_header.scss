  // Imagine that we want to have the logo on the top and then push all of these other
  // elements to the bottom. We can do this with fr, and then simply allow all the other
  // rows to be sized automatically.
  // It works in this case because the grid container actually has a very well-defined
  // height, and that height is 80% of the viewport height.
  // When you only set up your grid to have just one row at 1fr, that will be the only
  // explicit row you'll have, css grid then places the rest of the items in additional
  // implicit rows that only take up as much space as needed for the content inside. So if
  // you look at it sort of backwards; you have 6 items total, the last 5 items take up
  // only as much space as they need for their individual contents. That leaves the whole
  // rest of the grid to be taken up by the first item.
